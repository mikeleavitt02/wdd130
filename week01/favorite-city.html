</head Calgary is my favorite city>
<h1>Calgary is my favorite city</h1>
<p Calgary is my favorite city because it feels like home in every sense of the word—it’s where I was born and where
    some of my earliest memories were made. I love the mix of natural beauty and modern life, with the Rocky Mountains
    so close by and the energy of a growing, vibrant city all around. Calgary has a special spirit of resilience and
    friendliness, something I’ve always admired and carried with me. No matter where I go, Calgary will always hold a
    special place in my heart because it’s not only a city I love, but also the place that shaped the beginning of my
    life>
