    <h1>Calgary is my favorite city</h1>
    <p>
        Calgary is my favorite city because it feels like home in every sense of the word—it’s where I was born and
        where
        some of my earliest memories were made. I love the mix of natural beauty and modern life, with the Rocky
        Mountains
        so close by and the energy of a growing, vibrant city all around. Calgary has a special spirit of resilience and
        friendliness, something I’ve always admired and carried with me. No matter where I go, Calgary will always hold
        a
        special place in my heart because it’s not only a city I love, but also the place that shaped the beginning of
        my
        life.
    </p>
